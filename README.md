# The Transcript Viewer

A newspaper-styled web app that turns YouTube video transcripts into readable, well-formatted articles with chapters and speaker splits.

## Getting Started

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install
npm start
```

This runs both the Python transcript API (`localhost:3001`) and the Ember frontend (`localhost:4200`). Paste any YouTube URL and hit **Read**.
